00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Welcome to the Caption Toolkit
demonstration. This scene showcases an

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,140
automated caption system designed for
Unity developers working on XR

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,940
applications. You are currently
experiencing head-mounted display captions

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,820
that follow your view. These captions
automatically appear when audio content is

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,400
detected, require no manual setup, and
support multiple simultaneous

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,420
audio sources. The system includes
automatic audio discovery,

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,980
real-time caption synchronization, and
flexible UI positioning.

8
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:36,040
Developers can simply drag audio clips and
SRT files into a database,

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,240
assign caption prefabs, and the system
handles everything else.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,880
In this demo, you will see captions that
move with your head,

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,660
captions that stay fixed to characters in
the scene,

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,600
and how the system seamlessly manages
multiple audio sources without conflicts.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,160
The Toolkit is designed for easy
integration into existing projects with

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,780
minimal code changes required.
